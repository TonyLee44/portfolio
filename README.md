Tony Lee's Portfolio.

You can run my website by forking the project from GitHub.
Open the terminal and run:
### `npm start`

My portfolio was built using ReactJS and importing my projects from projects.json.
The dependencies that I used are react, react-dom, react-router-dom, react-scripts.
This project is to introduce me and the web development projects that I have learned in a period of 6 months.
This also shows my experience with react, css grids, flexbox, scss and responsiveness. It also shows my
understanding of functional components of React.
